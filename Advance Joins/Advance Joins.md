### Basic Select
1. SQL Project Planning 

You are given a table, Projects, containing three columns: Task_ID, Start_Date and End_Date. It is guaranteed that the difference between the End_Date and the Start_Date is equal to 1 day for each row in the table.

![This is a Table image.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12894/1443819551-639948acc0-1.png "This is a sample image.")

If the End_Date of the tasks are consecutive, then they are part of the same project. Samantha is interested in finding the total number of different projects completed.

Write a query to output the start and end dates of projects listed by the number of days it took to complete the project in ascending order. If there is more than one project that have the same number of completion days, then order by the start date of the project.

Sample Input     

![This is a Table image.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12894/1443819440-1c40e943a1-2.png "This is a sample image.")

Sample Output

2015-10-28 2015-10-29
2015-10-30 2015-10-31
2015-10-13 2015-10-15
2015-10-01 2015-10-04

Explanation

The example describes following four projects:

- Project 1: Tasks 1, 2 and 3 are completed on consecutive days, so these are part of the project. Thus start date of - project is 2015-10-01 and end date is 2015-10-04, so it took 3 days to complete the project.
- Project 2: Tasks 4 and 5 are completed on consecutive days, so these are part of the project. Thus, the start date of project is 2015-10-13 and end date is 2015-10-15, so it took 2 days to complete the project.
- Project 3: Only task 6 is part of the project. Thus, the start date of project is 2015-10-28 and end date is 2015-10-29, so it took 1 day to complete the project.
- Project 4: Only task 7 is part of the project. Thus, the start date of project is 2015-10-30 and end date is 2015-10-31, so it took 1 day to complete the project.

2. Placements
   
  You are given three tables: Students, Friends and Packages. Students contains two columns: ID and Name. Friends contains two columns: ID and Friend_ID (ID of the ONLY best friend). Packages contains two columns: ID and Salary (offered salary in $ thousands per month).

![This is a Table image.](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/12895/1443820186-2a9b4939a8-1.png "This is a sample image.")

Write a query to output the names of those students whose best friends got offered a higher salary than them. Names must be ordered by the salary amount offered to the best friends. It is guaranteed that no two students got same salary offer.

Sample Input

Now,

- Samantha's best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 11.55
- Julia's best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 12.12
- Scarlet's best friend got offered a higher salary than her at 15.2
- Ashley's best friend did NOT get offered a higher salary than her

The name output, when ordered by the salary offered to their friends, will be:

- Samantha
- Julia
- Scarlet

4. Interviews
   
  Samantha interviews many candidates from different colleges using coding challenges and contests. Write a query to print the contest_id, hacker_id, name, and the sums of total_submissions, total_accepted_submissions, total_views, and total_unique_views for each contest sorted by contest_id. Exclude the contest from the result if all four sums are 0.

Note: A specific contest can be used to screen candidates at more than one college, but each college only holds 1 screening contest.

Input Format

The following tables hold interview data:

- Contests: The contest_id is the id of the contest, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who created the contest, and name is the name of the hacker.

```
Explanation

The contest 66406 is used in the college 11219. In this college 11219, challenges 18765 and 47127 are asked, so from the view and submission stats:

- Sum of total submissions = 27 + 56 + 28 =111

- Sum of total accepted submissions = 10 + 18 + 11 =39

- Sum of total views = 43 + 72 + 26 + 15 =156

- Sum of total unique views = 10 + 13 + 19 + 14 =56

Similarly, we can find the sums for contests 66556 and 94828.

5. 15 Days of learning SQL
   
  Julia conducted a 15 days of learning SQL contest. The start date of the contest was March 01, 2016 and the end date was March 15, 2016.

Write a query to print total number of unique hackers who made at least 1 submission each day (starting on the first day of the contest), and find the hacker_id and name of the hacker who made maximum number of submissions each day. If more than one such hacker has a maximum number of submissions, print the lowest hacker_id. The query should print this information for each day of the contest, sorted by the date.

Input Format

The following tables hold contest data:

Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

2016-03-05 1 36396 Frank
2016-03-06 1 20703 Angela
Explanation

On March 01, 2016 hackers 20703, 36396, 54373, and 79722 made submissions. There are 4 unique hackers who made at least one submission each day. As each hacker made one submission, 20703 is considered to be the hacker who made maximum number of submissions on this day. The name of the hacker is Angela.

On March 02, 2016 hackers 15758, 20703, and 79722 made submissions. Now 20703 and 79722 were the only ones to submit every day, so there are 2 unique hackers who made at least one submission each day. 79722 made 2 submissions, and name of the hacker is Michael.

On March 03, 2016 hackers 20703, 36396, and 79722 made submissions. Now 20703 and 79722 were the only ones, so there are 2 unique hackers who made at least one submission each day. As each hacker made one submission so 20703 is considered to be the hacker who made maximum number of submissions on this day. The name of the hacker is Angela.

On March 04, 2016 hackers 20703, 36396, 38289, and 62529 made submissions. Now 20703 and 79722 only submitted each day, so there are 2 unique hackers who made at least one submission each day. As each hacker made one submission so 20703 is considered to be the hacker who made maximum number of submissions on this day. The name of the hacker is Angela.

On March 05, 2016 hackers 20703, 36396, 38289 and 62529 made submissions. Now 20703 only submitted each day, so there is only 1 unique hacker who made at least one submission each day. 36396 made 2 submissions and name of the hacker is Frank.

On March 06, 2016 only 20703 made submission, so there is only 1 unique hacker who made at least one submission each day. 20703 made 1 submission and name of the hacker is Angela.
